# nosql-challenge
This repository is for module 12 challenge nosql-challenge. This challenge contains two main parts. The first part is 'Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up', and NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb is the main script. The data source establishments.json is imported to the dataframe by Mongo import for further steps. The second part is 'Update the Database' in which NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb is still used as the main script. A new set of data has been added to the database and some of the data types are updated. NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb is used in the third part as the 'Exploratory Analysis'. The following four questions are answered in this part
